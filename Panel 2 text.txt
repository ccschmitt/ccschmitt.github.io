Mississippian people settled over much of eastern North America during the Late Prehistoric period. The people who built and occupied Aztalan (ca. A.D. 1100-1250) replicated major features found at the principal Mississippian site and ceremonial center of Cahokia, located near present day St. Louis. At Cahokia, these features included an extensive stockade, platform and other mounds, a large central plaza, distinct ritual and residential areas, agricultural fields, as well as a "woodhenge" used to predict the seasonal solstices and equinoxes.

Middle Photo Caption: Archaeological research at Aztalan, including analysis of stone tools and pottery, indicates a direct connection with Cahokia - at least some of Aztalan's residents appear to have come from the Cahokia area. The Crawfish River provided ready access from Aztalan to Cahokia via the Rock and Mississippi Rivers.
