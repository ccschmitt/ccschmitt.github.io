Indian peoples occupied this area off and on for many years before a new group of Indian people arrived who built the large mounds and other prehistoric features that now characterize Aztalan, a federally-designated National Historic Landmark.

The people who inhabited the prehistoric village of Aztalan (ca. A.D. 1100-1250) hailed from the majot Mississippian town of Cahokia, located near present-day St. Louis. Aztalan is one of Cahokia's northernmost settlements.

Why the people of Aztalan chose this location and why they later abandoned it is unclear. However, the location did provide an important transportation route (with access to Cahokia via the Crawfish, Rock, and Mississippi Rivers) as well as abundant local plant, animal, and other resources.

In addition to hunting and gathering, the people grew corn, squash, sunflower and tobacco. Trading with other resident Indian communities also likely occurred.
